      	<h2>History of sushi</h2>
      	<p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that has a rich history
		dating back over 1,000 years. The origins of sushi can be traced
		back to Southeast Asia, where people would preserve fish by wrapping 
		it in fermented rice. Over time, sushi evolved into the dish we
		know today, with the development of new techniques and the addition
		of ingredients such as vinegar, seaweed, and wasabi. During the Edo
		period in Japan (1603-1868), sushi became widely popular, and the
		sushi chefs began to specialize in the art of making sushi. Today
		, sushi is enjoyed around the world and has become a staple in
		Japanese cuisine.</p>
