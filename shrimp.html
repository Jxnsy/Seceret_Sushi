		<ul>
			<li>2 cups of sushi rice</li>
			<li>2 1/4 cups of water</li>
			<li>1/4 cup of rice vinegar</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
			<li>4 sheets of Nori seaweed</li>
			<li>8 cooked shrimp</li>
			<li>1 ripe avocado</li>
			<li>1/2 cucumber, peeled and sliced into thin stripes</li>
			<li>Soy sauce for dipping</li>
			<li>Pickled ginger and wasabi (optional)</li>
		</ul>
						
		Instructions:
		<ol>
			<li>Rinse the sushi rice in cold water several times until the water becomes clear. Drain the rice in a fine-mesh sieve and let it sit for 30 minutes.</li>
			<li>In a medium-sized pot, combine the rice and water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for about 20 minutes or until the rice is fully cooked and the water has been absorbed.</li>
			<li>While the rice is cooking, prepare the sushi vinegar by combining the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the sugar has dissolved, stirring occasionally.</li>
			<li>Once the rice has finished cooking, transfer it to a large bowl and pour the sushi vinegar over it. Mix the rice and vinegar together using a spatula or wooden spoon, being careful not to mash the rice.</li>
			<li>Lay a sheet of nori seaweed on a sushi mat with the shiny side facing down. Dip your fingers in water to prevent the rice from sticking and grab a small handful of sushi rice.</li>
			<li>Spread the rice over the nori seaweed, leaving a 1-inch gap at the top edge of the seaweed. Press the rice down gently to create an even layer.</li>
			<li>Cut the cooked shrimp in half lengthwise and remove the tails. Cut the avocado and cucmber into thin strips</li>	
			<li>place two halves of shrimp, avocado slices and cucumber slices horizontally across the centre of the rice</li>
			<li>Grab the edge of the sushi mat closest to you and begin rolling it up tightly, using your fingers to press the filling in as you go. When you reach the end of the roll, use a bit of water to seal the edge of the nori seaweed.</li>
			<li>Repeat steps 5-8 with the remaining ingredients until you have made as many sushi rolls as desired.</li>
			<li>Use a sharp knife to slice each sushi roll into 6-8 pieces, wiping the blade clean between each cut to prevent sticking.</li>
			<li>Serve the sushi rolls with soy sauce for dipping and optional pickled ginger and wasabi on the side.</li>
			<li>Enjoy your delicious homemade Shrimp sushi rolls!</li>
